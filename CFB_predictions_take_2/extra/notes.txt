I BROKE CLEAN CALC WHEN ADDING THE OLD DATA TO IT NEED TO FIX ASAP BEFORE MOVING FORWARD DATA IS RUINED
    make sure get_past_years.py data is formated exactly the same

NEXT TIME
    ELO is added but something werid is happening in calc elo is bring score down even tho it should be increasing fix this(im leaving this be for now its confusing me why no major increase when changing elo weight) 
    create seperate python file for getting past data so i dont need to re run ever week
    alter clean_calc so it does past too (may want fail safe or seperate file for this calc so dont have to do it every time only should do it once a year)
    then may be finally time for the model 

For data calculations need(in order):
    cumliative up to that certain week
    rolling averages up to that certain week(most likely in 3 week stents will play around with to find the optimal amount)
    scoreing functions for teams offenses and defense to see strength of scedule(make sure that rolling averages aren't skewed due to weak play) prolly make rolling too right?
    self join combining opp team data on the same week
    drop excese columns

NOTE: as of now i think the rolling averages are including the week they are on it should just be the weeks before
    this isn't an issue i think just use the weeks before rolling averages and sums to predict the outcome of the next week
(DONE)NOTE: need a binary win or loss can just take the score of both and see which is bigger



will probably want to do all this for multiple seasons for training purposes
need to figure out what model to do thinking XGboost rn

Betting porportion formula:
    f* => the fraction of the current bankroll to wager
    p => probability of a win
    q => 1 - p is the probability of a loss
    b => porportion of the bet gained with a win
        if betting 10 dollars on 2-to-1 odds (returned 30 winning 20) then b = 20/10 = 2.0

    f* = p - q/b = p - (1 - p)/b

    EX.
        53.7 - (1 - 53.7)/2.5 - 1 = .0835

NEED TO PROBABLY DO LATER DOWN THE LINE:
    implement elo for scoring functions as of now will just use ap poll rankings
    do something like: https://blog.collegefootballdata.com/talking-tech-elo-ratings/



JUST HERE INCASE I WANT TO READD

#prolling getting rid of rolling sum seems usless
        combined_data[f"{col}_rolling_sum"] = (

            .sum()
            .reset_index(level=0, drop=True)
