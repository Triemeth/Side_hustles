MODEL QUESTIONS
    do i want to break it down on a school to school bases or just feed model everythinh and see what happens might just try both ngl
    for model not on a school to school bases will need to make a new dataframe of all upcoming games with those rolling averages matching opponents

NEXT TIME
    ELO is added but something werid is happening in calc elo is bring score down even tho it should be increasing fix this(im leaving this be for now its confusing me why no major increase when changing elo weight) 
    then may be finally time for the model 

For data calculations need(in order):
    cumliative up to that certain week
    rolling averages up to that certain week(most likely in 3 week stents will play around with to find the optimal amount)
    scoreing functions for teams offenses and defense to see strength of scedule(make sure that rolling averages aren't skewed due to weak play) prolly make rolling too right?
    self join combining opp team data on the same week
    drop excese columns

NOTE: as of now i think the rolling averages are including the week they are on it should just be the weeks before
    this isn't an issue i think just use the weeks before rolling averages and sums to predict the outcome of the next week
(DONE)NOTE: need a binary win or loss can just take the score of both and see which is bigger



will probably want to do all this for multiple seasons for training purposes
need to figure out what model to do thinking XGboost rn

Betting porportion formula:
    f* => the fraction of the current bankroll to wager
    p => probability of a win
    q => 1 - p is the probability of a loss
    b => porportion of the bet gained with a win
        if betting 10 dollars on 2-to-1 odds (returned 30 winning 20) then b = 20/10 = 2.0

    f* = p - q/b = p - (1 - p)/b

    EX.
        53.7 - (1 - 53.7)/2.5 - 1 = .0835

NEED TO PROBABLY DO LATER DOWN THE LINE:
    implement elo for scoring functions as of now will just use ap poll rankings
    do something like: https://blog.collegefootballdata.com/talking-tech-elo-ratings/
